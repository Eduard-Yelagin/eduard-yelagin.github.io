#### Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics, advised by [Prof. Gaynanova (UMich BioSTAT)](https://irinagain.github.io/), [Prof. Qian (TAMU ECE)](http://xqian37.github.io/), and [Prof. Carroll (TAMU STAT)](https://carroll.stat.tamu.edu/). My research centers on **time series forecasting and inference**, with a specific emphasis on developing computationally tractable methods with certain guarantees on their behavior. The primary motivation for my research is **biomedical (wearables) data**.

<!-- My research focuses on developing **deep learning** models for **biomedical data** and utilizing probabilistic techniques to create accurate **uncertainty quantification** methods for these models. Previously, I have worked on advancing deep learning methods for inferring physical properties of granular materials. In general, I enjoy exploring topics at the interface of computational and theoretical sciences. -->

During PhD, I have interned at **Amazon** as an Applied Scientist, working under Richard Chen and Cheng Ji. My projects have focused on developing (1) a **multi-task deep learning** models for detecting customer abuse and fraud, and (2) a **probability calibration** method for imbalanced datasets. 

Before, I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Economics (double degree) at the [University of Oklahoma](https://math.ou.edu/), graduating top-1% of my class. 

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and traveling.
