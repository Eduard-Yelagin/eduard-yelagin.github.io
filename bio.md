#### Short Bio

I am a Statistics Ph.D. student at [Texas A&M University](https://stat.tamu.edu/), advised by [**Dr. Irina Gaynanova**](https://irinagain.github.io/). I am also honored to be co-advised by [**Dr. Xiaoning Qian**](http://xqian37.github.io/) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I am mainly interested in developing approaches to probabilistic forecasting that allow robust uncertainty quantification for predictions. Previously, I have worked on advancing ML (DL) methods for inferring physical properties of granular materials. In general, I enjoy exploring topics at the interface of computational and theoretical sciences.

I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Economics (double degree) at the [University of Oklahoma](https://math.ou.edu/), graduating on top of my class. Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and traveling.

During my Ph.D., I have interned at **Amazon Science** as an Applied Scientist, working with an amazing group led by Cheng Ji to develop an interpretable multi-task algorithm for fraud and abuse detection.
