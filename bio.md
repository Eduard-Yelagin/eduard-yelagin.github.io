#### Short Bio

I am a Statistics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University, advised by Dr. Irina Gaynanova. I am also honored to be co-advised by Dr. Xiaoning Qian at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I am mainly interested in developing approaches to probabilistic forecasting that allow robust uncertainty quantification for predictions. Previously, I have worked on advancing ML (DL) methods for inferring physical properties of granular materials. In general, I enjoy exploring topics at the interface of computational and theoretical sciences.

I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Economics (double degree) at the University of Oklahoma, graduating on top of my class. Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and traveling.
