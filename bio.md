#### Short Bio

I am a PhD student in Statistics at Texas A&M University, under the guidance of [Professor Irina Gaynanova](https://irinagain.github.io/) and co-advised by [Professor Xiaoning Qian](http://xqian37.github.io/) from the Electrical Engineering Department. 

My research focuses on developing **deep learning** models for **biomedical data** and utilizing probabilistic techniques to create accurate **uncertainty quantification** methods for these models. Previously, I have worked on advancing deep learning methods for inferring physical properties of granular materials. In general, I enjoy exploring topics at the interface of computational and theoretical sciences.

I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Economics (double degree) at the [University of Oklahoma](https://math.ou.edu/), graduating on top of my class. Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and traveling.

During my Ph.D., I have interned at **Amazon** as an Applied Scientist, working with an amazing group led by Cheng Ji to develop an interpretable multi-task algorithm for fraud and abuse detection.
